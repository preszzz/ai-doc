## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.

## Key Components

- **Data**: The foundation of machine learning
- **Algorithms**: Methods for learning from data
- **Models**: Representations learned from data
- **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance

## Core Principles

- **Learning from Experience**: Improving with more data
- **Pattern Recognition**: Finding structure in data
- **Generalization**: Applying learning to new situations
- **Optimization**: Finding the best solutions

## Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
2. **Feature Engineering**
3. **Model Selection and Training**
4. **Evaluation and Validation**
5. **Deployment and Monitoring**

## Key Challenges

- **Data Quality and Quantity**
- **Model Selection**
- **Overfitting and Underfitting**
- **Computational Resources**
- **Interpretability**

## Best Practices

- **Data-Centric Approach**
- **Iterative Development**
- **Regular Evaluation**
- **Continuous Monitoring**
- **Documentation**
