# Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods are powerful machine learning techniques that combine multiple base models to create a more robust and accurate predictive model. This approach often leads to better performance than using individual models alone.

## Overview

Ensemble methods work by training multiple models and combining their predictions in some way. The key idea is that by combining different models, we can reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.

## Key Concepts

- **Model Diversity**: The importance of having diverse base models
- **Combination Methods**: Different ways to combine model predictions
- **Bias-Variance Trade-off**: How ensembles help reduce both bias and variance

## Common Ensemble Techniques

### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
- Random sampling with replacement
- Parallel model training
- Voting/averaging for final predictions
- Example: Random Forests

### Boosting
- Sequential model training
- Focus on difficult examples
- Weighted combination of models
- Examples: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting

### Stacking
- Meta-learning approach
- Using predictions as new features
- Training a meta-model
- Cross-validation importance

## Implementation Considerations

- Model selection for base learners
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Computational resources
- Trade-offs between different ensemble methods

## Best Practices

1. Ensure base model diversity
2. Balance complexity and performance
3. Consider computational constraints
4. Validate on independent test sets
5. Monitor for overfitting

## Advanced Topics

- **Dynamic Ensembles**: Adapting ensemble composition
- **Heterogeneous Ensembles**: Combining different types of models
- **Online Ensembles**: Updating ensembles with new data
