## 1.1.1 Data Representations
### Scalar (标量)
A single number, often used to represent magnitude. Rank-0 tensor.

```python
x = 1
```

### Vector (向量)
An ordered array of scalars, which can define position in space relative to an origin. Rank-1 tensor.

```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

### Matrix (矩阵)
A 2-D grid of numbers, capable of representing linear transformations or data sets. Rank-2 tensor

```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

### Tensor (张量)
A generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices to an n-dimensional space for any n greater than 2. It is an arrangement of matrices, Rank-3 (a cube) and higher
