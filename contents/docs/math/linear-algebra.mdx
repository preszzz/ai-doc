Linear algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and linear functions. It serves as the backbone for many machine learning and AI algorithms, from basic data transformations to complex neural networks.

## Why Linear Algebra in AI?

Linear algebra provides the mathematical framework for:
- Representing data in vector and matrix form
- Transforming and manipulating high-dimensional data
- Solving systems of equations efficiently
- Implementing key machine learning algorithms

## Key Concepts

1. **Vectors and Matrices**
   - Vectors as ordered lists of numbers: $\mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, ..., v_n]^T$
   - Matrices as 2D arrays: $\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}$
   - Vector operations:
     * Addition: $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = [u_1 + v_1, ..., u_n + v_n]^T$
     * Scalar multiplication: $c\mathbf{v} = [cv_1, ..., cv_n]^T$
     * Dot product: $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^n u_iv_i$
   - Matrix operations:
     * Addition: $(A + B)_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}$
     * Multiplication: $(AB)_{ij} = \sum_k a_{ik}b_{kj}$

2. **Vector Spaces**
   - Linear independence: $c_1\mathbf{v_1} + ... + c_n\mathbf{v_n} = \mathbf{0}$ only when $c_i = 0$
   - Basis vectors: Span the space with minimal linear independent set
   - Dimension: Number of basis vectors
   - Subspaces: Vector spaces contained within larger spaces

3. **Linear Transformations**
   - Matrix representations: $T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$
   - Properties:
     * $T(c\mathbf{v}) = cT(\mathbf{v})$
     * $T(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = T(\mathbf{u}) + T(\mathbf{v})$
   - Common transformations:
     * Rotation: $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$
     * Scaling: $\begin{bmatrix} s_x & 0 \\ 0 & s_y \end{bmatrix}$

4. **Systems of Linear Equations**
   - Matrix form: $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$
   - Solution methods:
     * Gaussian elimination
     * LU decomposition
     * Matrix inverse: $\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\mathbf{b}$
   - Computational complexity: $O(n^3)$ for $n \times n$ system

## Applications in AI

Linear algebra is essential in:

1. **Neural Networks**
   ```python
   # Matrix multiplication in neural network layer
   def forward_layer(X, W, b):
       return np.dot(X, W) + b  # X: input, W: weights, b: bias
   ```

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   ```python
   # PCA implementation using SVD
   def pca(X, n_components):
       U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(X - X.mean(axis=0))
       return np.dot(U[:, :n_components], np.diag(S[:n_components]))
   ```

3. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Word embeddings: $\text{word2vec}(w) \in \mathbb{R}^d$
   - Document vectors: TF-IDF matrices
   - Attention mechanisms: $\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$

4. **Computer Vision**
   - Image convolutions
   - Feature transformations
   - Spatial transformations

## Code Examples

```python
import numpy as np

# Basic vector operations
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)
norm = np.linalg.norm(v1)

# Matrix operations
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
matrix_product = np.dot(A, B)
inverse = np.linalg.inv(A)

# Solving linear systems
x = np.linalg.solve(A, v1[:2])
