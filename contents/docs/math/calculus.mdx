The origins of calculus go back at least 2500 years to the ancient Greeks, who found areas using the “method of exhaustion”(穷竭法) to inscribe polygons in the circle and circumscribe polygons about the circle and then let the number of sides of the polygons increase.

## 1.2.1 Limits
### Definition
Suppose $f(x)$ is approaches $L$ when all $x$ is sufficiently close to $a$, from both sides without actually letting $x$ be $a$.
$$\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$

### Slope of a Curve
The idea is to calculate the slope of the tangent line, the instantaneous rate of change of a function, as $x$ approaches $a$.
$$\lim\limits_{x\to a}\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}$$
This limit could also be written as,
$$\lim\limits_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
