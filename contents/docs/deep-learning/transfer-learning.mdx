title: Transfer Learning
---

Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models on one task and adapts them to a different but related task. This approach is particularly useful when the target task has limited data, allowing models to benefit from knowledge gained in the source task.

## Key Concepts

### What is Transfer Learning?
- **Pre-trained Model**:
  - A model trained on a large dataset (source task).
  - Examples: ImageNet-trained models, BERT for NLP.
- **Fine-tuning**:
  - Adapting the pre-trained model to the target task by continuing training on the target dataset.

### Why Transfer Learning?
- Saves computational resources and time.
- Improves performance on tasks with limited labeled data.
- Enables learning generalized representations.

## Types of Transfer Learning

1. **Feature Extraction**:
  - Use the pre-trained model as a feature extractor by freezing its layers.
  - Only the final layer is retrained for the target task.

  Example:
  - Extract image features using a pre-trained CNN like ResNet.
  - Train a classifier on top of these features.

2. **Fine-tuning**:
  - Retrain some or all layers of the pre-trained model on the target task.
  - Useful when the target task is closely related to the source task.

3. **Domain Adaptation**:
  - Transfer knowledge between domains with different data distributions.
  - Example: Adapting a sentiment analysis model trained on product reviews to movie reviews.

## Steps in Transfer Learning

### 1. Select a Pre-trained Model
- Choose a model pre-trained on a dataset similar to your task.
- Common pre-trained models:
  - **Computer Vision**: ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet.
  - **Natural Language Processing**: BERT, GPT, RoBERTa.

### 2. Modify the Architecture
- Replace the output layer to match the target task.
  - For classification: Adjust the number of output nodes to the target classes.
  - For regression: Use a single output node with a linear activation function.

### 3. Train the Model
- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Freeze the pre-trained layers.
  - Train only the newly added layers.
- **Fine-tuning**:
  - Unfreeze some pre-trained layers.
  - Train the entire model with a lower learning rate.

## Advantages
- Requires less training data for the target task.
- Reduces training time and computational cost.
- Leverages rich, generalized features learned on large datasets.

---

## Challenges
- **Domain Mismatch**:
  - Differences between source and target domains can reduce transferability.
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**:
  - Fine-tuning can overwrite useful knowledge from pre-trained weights.
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**:
  - Requires careful tuning of learning rates and layer freezing/unfreezing.

## Example: Fine-tuning a Pre-trained CNN
1. Load a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50).
2. Replace the output layer for the target classification task:
   $$
   \text{New Output Layer: } \text{Dense}(n\_classes, \text{activation}='softmax')
   $$
3. Freeze all layers except the output layer:
  ```python
  for layer in model.layers[:-1]:
    layer.trainable = False
  ```
4. Train on the target dataset with a lower learning rate.
