title: Computer Vision
---

Computer Vision is a field of AI focused on enabling machines to interpret and process visual information, such as images and videos, in a manner similar to the human visual system. Leveraging deep learning, computer vision has achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Image Representation
Images are typically represented as matrices of pixel values:
- **Grayscale Images**:
  - Single channel matrix with intensity values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
- **Color Images**:
  - 3-channel (RGB) matrices, where each channel represents the intensity of red, green, and blue.

### 2. Feature Extraction
Deep learning models automatically extract features from images to learn patterns. Early layers detect simple features like edges, while deeper layers capture complex patterns like shapes or objects.

## Core Tasks

### 1. Image Classification
- Assigns a single label to an entire image.
- Example: Identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog.
- **Common Architectures**:
  - AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet.

### 2. Object Detection
- Identifies and localizes multiple objects in an image by drawing bounding boxes and assigning labels.
- Example: Detecting cars, pedestrians, and traffic lights in a street scene.
- **Popular Models**:
  - YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector).

### 3. Image Segmentation
- Divides an image into regions of interest by assigning each pixel to a specific category.
  - **Semantic Segmentation**: Assigns categories to all pixels (e.g., road, sky, car).
  - **Instance Segmentation**: Differentiates between multiple objects of the same class.
- **Notable Models**:
  - U-Net, DeepLab.

### 4. Image Generation
- Creates new images that resemble real-world data.
- Techniques:
  - GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).
  - VAEs (Variational Autoencoders).

## Techniques and Models

### 1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are the backbone of computer vision tasks. They efficiently capture spatial hierarchies in images through:
- Convolutions.
- Pooling.
- Fully connected layers.

### 2. Transfer Learning
- Pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG are fine-tuned for specific vision tasks, reducing training time and improving performance.

### 3. Vision Transformers (ViT)
- Treat images as sequences of patches and apply transformer architectures.
- Highly effective for large-scale vision tasks.

### 4. Data Augmentation
- Enhances the diversity of training data by applying transformations like:
  - Flipping, rotation, scaling.
  - Color adjustments, cropping.
  - Adding noise.

## Applications

### 1. Autonomous Vehicles
- Object detection for recognizing pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs.
- Lane detection using image segmentation.

### 2. Medical Imaging
- Cancer detection in MRI or CT scans.
- Organ segmentation for surgical planning.

### 3. Facial Recognition
- Identifying individuals in images or videos.
- Applications in security and authentication.

### 4. Retail and E-commerce
- Product recommendation using visual search.
- Inventory management with object detection.

### 5. Augmented Reality
- Enhances real-world environments by overlaying virtual objects.
- Used in gaming, training, and education.
