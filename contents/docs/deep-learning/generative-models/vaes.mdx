title: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
---

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a class of generative models that learn to encode data into a latent space and decode it back to reconstruct the input. Unlike traditional autoencoders, VAEs impose a probabilistic structure on the latent space, enabling the generation of new data samples.

## Key Concepts

### Probabilistic Latent Space
- In VAEs, the encoder maps input data $x$ to a probability distribution over the latent space, rather than a single point.
- The latent space follows a prior distribution, typically a Gaussian:
  $$
  z \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
  $$

### Generative Process
1. Sample latent vector $z$ from the prior distribution.
2. Decode $z$ to reconstruct the data:
  $$
  \hat{x} = D(z)
  $$

### Components of VAEs
1. **Encoder (Inference Network)**:
  - Encodes input data $x$ into the parameters of the latent distribution (mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$):
    $$
    q(z \mid x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu(x), \sigma^2(x))
    $$

2. **Decoder (Generative Network)**:
  - Generates data $\hat{x}$ from a latent vector $z$:
    $$
    p(x \mid z)
    $$

## Loss Function

The VAE loss consists of two terms:
1. **Reconstruction Loss**:
  - Measures how well the decoded data $\hat{x}$ matches the original input $x$:
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}} = -\mathbb{E}_{q(z \mid x)} [\log p(x \mid z)]
    $$
  - For image data, this is often implemented using binary cross-entropy or mean squared error.

2. **KL Divergence**:
  - Regularizes the latent space by minimizing the divergence between the learned distribution $q(z \mid x)$ and the prior $p(z)$:
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}} = D_{\text{KL}}(q(z \mid x) \parallel p(z))
    $$
  - Ensures the latent space follows a Gaussian distribution.

### Total Loss
The combined loss is:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{VAE}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}
$$

## Sampling and Reparameterization Trick
- Directly sampling $z \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ is non-differentiable.
- The reparameterization trick makes this process differentiable:
  $$
  z = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
  $$
  Where $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

## Applications
1. **Data Generation**:
  - Generate new data samples resembling the training set (e.g., images, text).
2. **Anomaly Detection**:
  - Identify data points with low reconstruction probabilities as anomalies.
3. **Latent Space Manipulation**:
  - Modify latent vectors to control generative outputs (e.g., interpolate between two images).
4. **Semi-Supervised Learning**:
  - Use latent representations as features for downstream tasks.

## Advantages
- Smooth and continuous latent space.
- Capable of both reconstruction and data generation.
- Probabilistic nature provides uncertainty estimates.

## Challenges
- Reconstructions may lack sharpness compared to GANs.
- Tuning the balance between reconstruction loss and KL divergence can be difficult.
- Limited flexibility in modeling complex data distributions due to Gaussian assumptions.

## Extensions of VAEs
1. **Beta-VAE**:
  - Introduces a scaling factor $\beta$ for the KL divergence term to control the trade-off between reconstruction and disentanglement:
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{Beta-VAE}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}
    $$

2. **Conditional VAE (CVAE)**:
  - Conditions the generative process on additional inputs (e.g., class labels):
    $$
    p(x \mid z, c)
    $$

3. **Vector Quantized VAE (VQ-VAE)**:
  - Uses discrete latent variables, enabling applications in image synthesis and speech processing.

## Summary
Variational Autoencoders combine probabilistic modeling with deep learning to create a versatile framework for generative tasks. Their smooth latent space and probabilistic interpretations make VAEs a fundamental tool in modern generative modeling, though they are often complemented by other techniques like GANs for sharper outputs.
