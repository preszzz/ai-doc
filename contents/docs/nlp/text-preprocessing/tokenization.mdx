title: Tokenization
---

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, characters, or subwords, serving as the fundamental building blocks for text processing.

## Types of Tokenization

### Word Tokenization
Splits text into individual words:
```python
text = "The quick brown fox jumps."
tokens = ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "."]
```

### Character Tokenization
Splits text into individual characters:
```python
text = "Hello"
tokens = ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
```

### Subword Tokenization
Creates tokens that can be parts of words:
```python
# Using BPE tokenization
text = "understanding"
tokens = ["under", "stand", "ing"]
```

## Common Approaches

### 1. Rule-Based
- Split on whitespace
- Handle punctuation
- Consider special cases

```python
def simple_tokenize(text):
    return text.split()
```

### 2. Regular Expressions
More sophisticated pattern matching:
```python
import re

def regex_tokenize(text):
    return re.findall(r'\w+|[^\w\s]', text)
```

### 3. Advanced Tokenizers
Modern NLP often uses subword tokenizers:
- **WordPiece**: Used by BERT
- **BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding)**: Used by GPT
- **SentencePiece**: Language-agnostic approach

## Best Practices

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Convert to lowercase (if needed)
   - Handle special characters
   - Remove unwanted elements

2. **Language Considerations**:
   - Different languages need different approaches
   - Consider Unicode normalization

3. **Domain Specifics**:
   - Handle domain-specific terms
   - Preserve important symbols/numbers

## Implementation Example

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load a pretrained tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize text
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
print(tokens)

# Convert to token IDs
token_ids = tokenizer.encode(text)
print(token_ids)
```

## Challenges

1. **Ambiguity**:
   - Word boundaries in different languages
   - Handling contractions and abbreviations

2. **Special Cases**:
   - URLs and email addresses
   - Hashtags and mentions
   - Technical terms

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Processing large texts
   - Memory management
   - Speed considerations

## Summary

Tokenization is a crucial first step in NLP pipelines. The choice of tokenization method can significantly impact downstream tasks, making it essential to select appropriate approaches based on your specific use case.
