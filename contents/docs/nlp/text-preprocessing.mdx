# Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is a crucial first step in any NLP pipeline. It involves cleaning and standardizing text data to make it suitable for analysis and model training.

## Tokenization

### Word Tokenization
- Breaking text into individual words
- Handling punctuation and special characters
- Different tokenization strategies
- Language-specific considerations

### Sentence Tokenization
- Splitting text into sentences
- Handling abbreviations and special cases
- Multi-language support
- Rule-based vs. ML-based approaches

## Text Normalization

### Case Normalization
- Converting to lowercase/uppercase
- Preserving proper nouns
- Context-dependent normalization

### Character Normalization
- Unicode normalization
- Handling special characters
- Removing accents
- Standardizing formats

## Noise Removal

### Cleaning Special Characters
- Removing punctuation
- Handling HTML/XML tags
- Dealing with emojis and symbols
- Preserving meaningful characters

### Whitespace Management
- Removing extra spaces
- Handling newlines and tabs
- Preserving sentence boundaries

## Stop Words

### Stop Word Removal
- Common stop word lists
- Language-specific stop words
- Context-dependent removal
- Impact on analysis

### Custom Stop Words
- Domain-specific stop words
- Creating custom lists
- Evaluation of impact

## Text Standardization

### Spelling Correction
- Dictionary-based approaches
- Statistical methods
- Context-aware correction
- Handling domain-specific terms

### Text Segmentation
- Word segmentation
- Compound word handling
- Language-specific challenges

## Advanced Preprocessing

### Regular Expressions
- Pattern matching
- Text extraction
- Complex replacements
- Validation rules

### Language Detection
- Automatic language identification
- Multi-language document handling
- Confidence scores

## Best Practices

1. Document preprocessing steps
2. Maintain preprocessing consistency
3. Evaluate impact on downstream tasks
4. Consider domain-specific requirements
5. Handle edge cases appropriately

## Common Challenges

- Multi-language support
- Domain-specific terminology
- Social media text
- Informal language
- Preserving semantic meaning
